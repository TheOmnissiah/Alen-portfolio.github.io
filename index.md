About

In this project we had total creative control over what type of game we wanted to make, so i wanted to make an FPS. This game is centered around using the correct spell or weapon for 4 diefrent types of enemies and surrviving the swarm. More than anything this showed me real dev time and the need to compromise between what i want as a player and what is possible and logical as a developer.

This game was made in a week long game jam, it was made by myself, Krešimir Kučan, Ante Tavra and Domagoj Petrović. I was the main prop and level designer.
I was in charge of making the main rocket and making it look as of it was destroyed, and look futuristic. I made 7 diferent stages of repair with particle effects that change in every level in order to to look as progres.

<br>
This is a collecting game that I made as a part of the PISMO Unity course with the help from our mentor Cwekii.This was a exercise in game making where we we given some time to practice what wee have learned bx making a game where you go around and collect items with a time limit. I decided to go for an island with a few points of intrest and have used crystals as collectibles, as well as using it to practice post procesing effects in Unity and particle effects.
