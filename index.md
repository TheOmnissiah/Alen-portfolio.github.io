About

Let's agree that corporations are not trustworthy, they are greedy and most of the time have skeletons in their closets.  However they pay good money for a job well done, if you can cut it, unfortunately you can no longer choose. Earn every penny through destruction of your enemies using your guns and spells.



The game is still in development and you can try out our free demo which includes first two levels of the game and a tutorial. You can find weapons and spells so exploring the levels is worth it but it can be dangerous if you get swarmed. Depending on how you take care of the enemies you get drops, killing an enemy with a spell can drop ammo, killing an enemy with a gun can drop mana and killing an enemy with a melee attack can drop health kits.

This game was made in a week long game jam, it was made by myself, Krešimir Kučan, Ante Tavra and Domagoj Petrović. I was the main prop and level designer.
I was in charge of making the main rocket and making it look as of it was destroyed, and look futuristic. I made 7 diferent stages of repair with particle effects that change in every level in order to to look as progres.

This is a collecting game that I made as a part of the PISMO Unity course with the help from our mentor Cwekii.This was a exercise in game making where we we given some time to practice what wee have learned bx making a game where you go around and collect items with a time limit. I decided to go for an island with a few points of intrest and have used crystals as collectibles, as well as using it to practice post procesing effects in Unity and particle effects.
